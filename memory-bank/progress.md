# Progress: Reeper

## What Works

- Recipe CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- Image attachments and OCR extraction
- **OCR with AI cleanup:** OCR results can be cleaned up using GPT-4 Mini for better accuracy and formatting
- **OCR temporary storage:** OCR results are saved to a dedicated `ocr_text` field, shown on edit page for manual copy/paste
- **Language-aware AI processing:** GPT cleanup adapts to German/English with recipe-specific prompts
- Tagging and search/filtering
- Auth0 authentication
- AWS S3 file storage
- Dockerized development and production environments
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Database backup/restore

## What's Left to Build

- Enhanced import/export for recipes
- Improved mobile experience
- Plugin/extension architecture
- Advanced search (ingredient-based, fuzzy)
- Recipe scaling/conversion tools
- Community features (optional, future)

## Current Status

- Project is stable and in active development
- All core features are implemented and working
- **NEW:** GPT-powered OCR cleanup feature completed (September 2025)
- Recent upgrade to Ruby 3.4.5 completed
- No critical bugs open

# Progress Tracking

## Current Sprint

### In Progress
- [ ] AI OCR Recipe Extraction (PR #725)
  - Feature branch: `feature/ai-ocr`
  - Magic recipe functionality implementation
  - Status: Active development

### Recently Completed
- Previous features and tasks (to be updated based on git history)

## Upcoming Tasks
- Complete AI OCR feature
- Code review and testing for PR #725
- Documentation updates
- Integration testing

## Blockers
- None currently identified

## Technical Debt
- To be identified during feature development

## Notes
- Focus: Completing AI OCR feature on `feature/ai-ocr` branch
- PR #725 requires review before merge to main

## Known Issues

- Ruby upgrades require coordinated changes in Docker, workflows, and documentation
- S3 and Auth0 credentials must be managed securely
- OpenAI API usage should be monitored for cost control
- Occasional dependency update breakages (monitored via CI)
