# Progress: Reeper

## What Works

- Recipe CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- Image attachments and OCR extraction
- **OCR with AI cleanup:** OCR results can be cleaned up using GPT-4 Mini for better accuracy and formatting
- **OCR with image rotation:** Images can be rotated client-side for better OCR recognition without modifying stored files
- **OCR temporary storage:** OCR results are saved to a dedicated `ocr_text` field, shown on edit page for manual copy/paste
- **Language-aware AI processing:** GPT cleanup adapts to German/English with recipe-specific prompts
- Tagging and search/filtering
- Auth0 authentication
- AWS S3 file storage
- Dockerized development and production environments
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Database backup/restore

## What's Left to Build

- Enhanced import/export for recipes
- Improved mobile experience
- Plugin/extension architecture
- Advanced search (ingredient-based, fuzzy)
- Recipe scaling/conversion tools
- Community features (optional, future)

## Current Status

- Project is stable and in active development
- All core features are implemented and working
- **NEW:** GPT-powered OCR cleanup feature completed (September 2025)
- Recent upgrade to Ruby 3.4.5 completed
- No critical bugs open

## Recent Completions (September 2025)

### Image Rotation for OCR ✅ (September 12, 2025)
- **Implementation:** Complete and tested
- **Components:** Stimulus controller, CSS styling, backend integration
- **Features:**
  - Client-side rotation controls (90°, 180°, 270°, reset)
  - CSS transform-based visual feedback with smooth transitions
  - Session-only persistence (no database storage)
  - Backend MiniMagick integration for actual OCR processing
  - Preserves original stored images in ActiveStorage
- **Files Modified:** 5 files across controllers, views, stylesheets
- **Dependencies:** Leverages existing MiniMagick and Stimulus setup
- **UX:** Three intuitive buttons with rotation arrows and reset option

### GPT OCR Cleanup Feature ✅ (September 11, 2025)
- **Implementation:** Complete and tested
- **Components:** Controller action, service class, frontend integration
- **Features:** 
  - Language-aware prompts (German/English)
  - Recipe-specific cleanup optimization
  - Error handling and user feedback
  - Cost-effective GPT-4 Mini integration
- **Files Modified:** 7 files across controllers, services, views, routes, locales
- **Dependencies:** Added ruby-openai gem
- **Configuration:** OpenAI API key configured in Rails credentials

## Known Issues

- Ruby upgrades require coordinated changes in Docker, workflows, and documentation
- S3 and Auth0 credentials must be managed securely
- OpenAI API usage should be monitored for cost control
- Occasional dependency update breakages (monitored via CI)
