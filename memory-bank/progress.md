# Progress: Reeper

## What Works

- Recipe CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- Image attachments and OCR extraction
- Tagging and search/filtering
- Auth0 authentication
- AWS S3 file storage
- Dockerized development and production environments
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Database backup/restore

## Whatâ€™s Left to Build

- Enhanced import/export for recipes
- Improved mobile experience
- Plugin/extension architecture
- Advanced search (ingredient-based, fuzzy)
- Recipe scaling/conversion tools
- Community features (optional, future)

## Current Status

- Project is stable and in maintenance mode
- All core features are implemented and working
- Recent upgrade to Ruby 3.4.5 completed
- No critical bugs open

## Known Issues

- Ruby upgrades require coordinated changes in Docker, workflows, and documentation
- S3 and Auth0 credentials must be managed securely
- Occasional dependency update breakages (monitored via CI)
