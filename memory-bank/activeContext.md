# Active Context

## Current Focus: Legacy Tesseract OCR Removal
**Branch**: `feature/remove-tesseract`
**PR**: #759 - Remove Tesseract OCR
**Recent Activity**: Completed removal of all legacy Tesseract OCR components, including manual region selection interface, orphaned controllers, and unused dependencies

## Overview
The legacy Tesseract-based manual OCR system has been completely removed in favor of the AI-powered two-phase recognition feature. The application now uses only Mistral AI + OpenAI for recipe extraction from images, providing better accuracy and user experience without manual text region selection.

## Recently Completed
- ✅ Removed legacy Tesseract OCR interface (OcrController#show method)
- ✅ Deleted manual region selection views (show.html.erb, _imgregion.html.erb)
- ✅ Deleted unused application_wide.html.erb layout
- ✅ Removed JavaScript controllers (imgregion_controller.js, ocr_selection_controller.js)
- ✅ Cleaned up clipboard-polyfill dependency (imports and package removal)
- ✅ Updated routes to explicit configuration (removed show, save_text)
- ✅ Removed ocr_text field from recipes form
- ✅ Created migration to drop ocr_text column from database
- ✅ Removed all Tesseract/RTesseract references from documentation

## Current State
- On `feature/remove-tesseract` branch
- PR #759 open for Tesseract removal
- All legacy OCR components removed
- Migration ready (ocr_text column drop)
- Application using AI-only OCR workflow
- Ready for review and merge

## Active Implementation

### Legacy Tesseract OCR Removal (✅ COMPLETED)
All components removed:

1. **Views**: Deleted show.html.erb, _imgregion.html.erb, application_wide.html.erb
2. **Controllers**: Removed show, create, save_text methods from OcrController
3. **JavaScript**: Deleted imgregion_controller.js, ocr_selection_controller.js
4. **Routes**: Updated to explicit configuration, removed RESTful show and save_text routes
5. **Translations**: Removed ocr.show.* and recipes.form.ocr_text* keys
6. **Database**: Created migration to drop ocr_text column from recipes table
7. **Dependencies**: Removed clipboard-polyfill imports and package
8. **Documentation**: Updated all references to AI-only OCR approach

### What Was Removed
- **Manual OCR Interface**: Canvas-based region selection requiring Tesseract
- **Orphaned Controllers**: ocr_selection_controller.js (258 lines, no view references)
- **Unused Dependencies**: clipboard-polyfill package and imports
- **Database Field**: ocr_text column from recipes table (legacy storage)
- **Routes**: /ocr/:id (show), /ocr/:id/save_text endpoints
- **Layouts**: application_wide.html.erb (only used by removed show action)

## Active Dependencies
- OpenAI API with two prompts (ocr and markdown parsing)
- Mistral AI OCR service via OmniAI gem
- OcrResult model with `ai_method` tracking
- Ruby 3.4.8
- Rails 8.x
- Auth0 for authentication
- AWS S3 for file storage
- **Removed**: Tesseract command-line tool (no longer needed)
- **Removed**: RTesseract gem (already removed previously)
- **Removed**: clipboard-polyfill npm package

## Next Steps
1. 🔍 Review PR #759 (feature/remove-tesseract)
2. ✅ Merge PR #759 to main
3. 🚀 Deploy to production
4. 🧪 Verify AI-only OCR workflow in production
5. 📊 Monitor recipe extraction success rates
6. 🧹 Consider future cleanup: Remove ocr_text references in specs/tests

## Known Issues
- None currently - all legacy OCR components successfully removed

## Notes
- Application now uses AI-only OCR workflow (no manual region selection)
- All Tesseract dependencies removed from codebase
- Migration 20260123091620_remove_ocr_text_from_recipes.rb drops ocr_text column
- OcrController retains: cleanup_with_gpt, scan, reparse_image, show_recipe_selection
- All documentation updated to reflect AI-powered approach
