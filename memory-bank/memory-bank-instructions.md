# Copilot Memory Bank & Project Instructions

## Summary

This document defines how GitHub Copilot maintains project memory and context across sessions. Copilotâ€™s memory resets between sessions, so all project knowledge must be captured in the Memory Bank to ensure continuity, accuracy, and effective collaboration.

---

## Core Principle

**Copilot MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task.**

* No exceptions.
* Use this checklist before any work:

  * [ ] Read `projectbrief.md`
  * [ ] Read `productContext.md`
  * [ ] Read `systemPatterns.md`
  * [ ] Read `techContext.md`
  * [ ] Read `activeContext.md`
  * [ ] Read `progress.md`
  * [ ] Read `copilot-rules.md`
  * [ ] Read any additional context files in `/memory-bank/`

---

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of required core files and optional context files, all in Markdown. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC

    AC --> P[progress.md]
    AC --> CR[copilot-rules.md]
```

### Core Files (Required)

1. **projectbrief.md**
   Foundation document for all others. Defines core requirements, goals, and project scope.
2. **productContext.md**
   Why this project exists, problems it solves, user experience goals.
3. **systemPatterns.md**
   System architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, component relationships.
4. **techContext.md**
   Technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, dependencies.
5. **activeContext.md**
   Current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions.
6. **progress.md**
   What works, whatâ€™s left to build, current status, known issues.
7. **copilot-rules.md**
   Project rules, Copilot guidance, safety/security policies, evolving project patterns.

### Additional Context

Add extra files/folders in `/memory-bank/` for:

* Complex features
* Integration specs
* API docs
* Testing strategies
* Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> ReadFiles[Read Memory Bank]
    ReadFiles --> CheckFiles{Files Complete?}
    CheckFiles -->|No| Plan[Create Plan]
    Plan --> Document[Document in Chat]
    CheckFiles -->|Yes| Verify[Verify Context]
    Verify --> Strategy[Develop Strategy]
    Strategy --> Present[Present Approach]
```

**Description:**

* Always start by reading all memory bank files.
* If files are missing, create a plan and document it.
* If files are complete, verify context and develop a strategy before acting.

### Act Mode

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Start] --> Context[Check Memory Bank]
    Context --> Update[Update Documentation]
    Update --> Rules[Update copilot-rules.md if needed]
    Rules --> Execute[Execute Task]
    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]
```

**Description:**

* Check memory bank before any action.
* Update documentation as you work.
* Update `copilot-rules.md` if new patterns or rules are discovered.
* Document all changes.

---

## Documentation Updates

Update the Memory Bank when:

1. Discovering new project patterns or rules
2. After significant changes
3. When the user requests with **update memory bank** (review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[Update Process]
    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Update copilot-rules.md]
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end
    Start --> Process
```

**Note:**
On **update memory bank**, review every file, even if some donâ€™t require changes.
Focus on `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` for current state.

---

## Project Rules (`copilot-rules.md`)

This file is Copilotâ€™s and the teamâ€™s learning journal for the project. It captures:

* Critical implementation paths
* User preferences and workflow
* Project-specific patterns
* Security requirements and known challenges
* Evolution of project decisions
* Tool usage patterns

**Example: Core Security Rule**

```markdown
## ðŸš¨ Security: Never Upload Secrets

- Never copy, move, or commit secret files or values (e.g., `.env`, `secrets.json`, API keys, tokens, passwords) to version control or into example/sample config files.
- Example files like `.env.example` must be built by hand with only safe placeholder values.
- Always verify that no secrets are present before staging, committing, or pushing code.
- If a secret is ever committed, treat as a security incident: remove from history and rotate affected credentials immediately.
- Use secret scanning tools (e.g., GitHub Secret Scanning, TruffleHog, git-secrets) for extra safety.
```

## How to Use This Document

* Reference this file at the start of every session.
* Use the checklists and diagrams to guide your workflow.
* Update the Memory Bank and `copilot-rules.md` as you learn.
* Treat this as a living documentâ€”improve it as the project evolves.

---

**REMEMBER:**
After every memory reset, Copilot begins completely fresh. The Memory Bank is the only link to previous work. Maintain it with precision and clarityâ€”project effectiveness and security depend on its accuracy.
