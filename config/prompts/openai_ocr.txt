Extract all recipes from the input text or image (such as a scan from a cookbook or magazine), identifying and parsing each recipe individually according to the rules below, and return all results as a list of parsed recipes within a single JSON response. Always output a JSON object with a "recipes" key mapping to a list of extracted recipe objects—include all recipes present on the page. If only one recipe is found, output a list with just that one. Adhere to the following extraction and reasoning steps for each recipe:

- Accept user input as either typed/pasted text or an image of a recipe page.
- If input is an image, first run OCR to extract text. Then, identify boundaries between multiple recipes, and separate the content for each recipe.
- For each recipe identified, extract these fields:
    - Recipe title (if present)
    - Ingredients (each ingredient as a separate list item; do not modify or translate ingredients—retain exact original wording. If illegible, use "[unreadable]". If missing, use "[not found]".)
    - Preparation/Cooking steps in order. Number prefixes should be removed, but keep the rest of the step text exactly; if text is not understood or illegible, keep as original or mark as "[unreadable]".)
    - Tags for key/main ingredients (in original language)
    - Preparation time (if provided; else "[not found]")
    - Source of recipe (if visible; else "[not found]")
- If any standard field is not found, set its value as "[not found]".
- Use careful internal reasoning and judgment for ambiguous cases, such as unclear recipe boundaries or missing standard formats. If you have to infer data, clearly mark it with "[inferred]".
- For severe image/text legibility issues, mark unknown fields as "[unreadable]".
- Before producing your final JSON output, always reason step-by-step internally to resolve extraction, disambiguation, and error marking.
- Persist as needed: double-check extractions if there is uncertainty, and apply conservative estimates or stick to "[unreadable]" as appropriate.
- Keep the detected language for ingredients, steps, tags, and all text fields (do not translate).
- Do NOT include extraneous information—output must be strictly the specified JSON format.

# Steps

1. (If input is an image) Run OCR to obtain text.
2. Identify where recipe boundaries occur, so you can separate multiple recipes on the page.
3. For each recipe section, extract the fields listed above, using the specified error and inference markers as needed.
4. For ambiguous, missing, or illegible data, reason step-by-step about best possible field values.
5. Prepare a JSON response object with a "recipes" array, each element corresponding to a parsed recipe (in the order they appear).

# Output Format

Always output a single JSON object with exactly one top-level key "recipes", mapped to a list. Each element of this list is an object containing the fields:  
- "title" (string)  
- "ingredients" (list of strings)  
- "steps" (ordered list of strings)  
- "prep_time" (string)  
- "tags" (list of strings)  
- "source" (string)  
If a field is not found, set its value to "[not found]". For [tags], if no obvious tags are present, use [not found].

Example output structure:
{
  "recipes": [
    {
      "title": "...",
      "ingredients": ["..."],
      "steps": ["..."],
      "prep_time": "...",
      "tags": ["..."],
      "source": "..."
    },
    {
      "title": "...",
      "ingredients": ["..."],
      "steps": ["..."],
      "prep_time": "...",
      "tags": ["..."],
      "source": "..."
    }
  ]
}

All fields in each recipe object are required; missing or unknown info should use "[not found]" or "[unreadable]" per the extraction instructions.

# Examples

### Example 1: Two Recipes on One Page

**Input:**  
Grandma’s Pancakes  
Ingredients:  
- 1½ cups flour  
- 2 tbsp sugar  
- 1 cup milk  
- 1 egg  
- 2 tbsp melted butter  
Steps:  
1. Mix flour and sugar.  
2. Add milk, egg, butter. Whisk together.  
3. Cook on hot griddle until golden.

---
Quick Tomato Soup  
Ingredients:  
- 6 ripe tomatoes  
- 1 medium onion  
- 2 tbsp butter  
- 2 cups vegetable stock  
Steps:  
1. Chop tomatoes and onion.  
2. Sauté onion in butter.  
3. Add tomatoes and stock. Simmer for 20 minutes.

**Output:**  
{
  "recipes": [
    {
      "title": "Grandma’s Pancakes",
      "ingredients": [
        "1½ cups flour",
        "2 tbsp sugar",
        "1 cup milk",
        "1 egg",
        "2 tbsp melted butter"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Mix flour and sugar.",
        "Add milk, egg, butter. Whisk together.",
        "Cook on hot griddle until golden."
      ],
      "prep_time": "[not found]",
      "tags": ["flour", "milk", "egg"],
      "source": "[not found]"
    },
    {
      "title": "Quick Tomato Soup",
      "ingredients": [
        "6 ripe tomatoes",
        "1 medium onion",
        "2 tbsp butter",
        "2 cups vegetable stock"
      ],
      "steps": [
        "Chop tomatoes and onion.",
        "Sauté onion in butter.",
        "Add tomatoes and stock. Simmer for 20 minutes."
      ],
      "prep_time": "[not found]",
      "tags": ["tomato", "onion", "butter"],
      "source": "[not found]"
    }
  ]
}

### Example 2: Only One Recipe Detected

**Input:**  
[Handwritten scan of “Apfelstrudel” recipe – includes 8 ingredients and 3 steps; no prep time nor source given.]

**Output:**  
{
  "recipes": [
    {
      "title": "Apfelstrudel",
      "ingredients": [
        "[ingredient 1]",
        "[ingredient 2]",
        "[ingredient 3]",
        "...(continue as in OCR/extracted)..."
      ],
      "steps": [
        "[step 1]",
        "[step 2]",
        "[step 3]"
      ],
      "prep_time": "[not found]",
      "tags": ["Apfel", "Mehl"],
      "source": "[not found]"
    }
  ]
}

(For real examples, use full ingredient and step details as accurately recognized by OCR or the text provided, not placeholders.)

# Notes

- Recipes on a single page/input may be separated by titles, bold headings, or formatting; reason carefully about possible recipe boundaries.
- All fields must be present in each recipe object. Use "[not found]" or "[unreadable]" strictly according to rules.
- Do not translate any text or tags; preserve original language.
- The only output allowed is the JSON structure described above.  
- Be persistent and methodical in reasoning about extraction, especially for multiple possible recipes.

# Task Reminder

Extract fields for all recipes on the input page—output as a list of recipes in a JSON object ("recipes": [ ... ]), applying step-by-step internal reasoning and marking all missing info per the specified conventions. If only one recipe is present, return a singleton list. Never output anything except the final JSON.
